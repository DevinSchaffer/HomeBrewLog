## Brewing Notes
Mash temp was way lower than I anticipated. Was shooting for around 152-153, but even though I heated water to 166 it wasn't enough to maintain temp between the HLT and the mash tun. Will probably need to up the HLT temp if I'm interested in mashing at a higher temp.

## Tasting Notes
Very hoppy and surprisingly bitter. Grossly sweet, which is pretty promising considering the style.

## Tasting Notes
No perceptible off-flavors. Smells strongly yeasty. Relatively light in color, but that may be due to both the sample drawn at yeast cake and the fact I didn't realize the estimated color was so light. Definitely can taste alcohol, though that will likely balance out with time.
